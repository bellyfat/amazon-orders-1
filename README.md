amazon-orders
=============
Export your orders from amazon.de

Based on the idea of [CyberLine/amazon-parser](https://github.com/CyberLine/amazon-parser),
this allows you to export your orders from amazon.de - without needing or opening a browser window.

This is only tested on amazon.de, since amazon.com offers an [integrated CSV export](https://www.amazon.com/gp/b2b/reports) of your orders, amazon.de does not.

By default this script ignores free orders and orders that were returned and refunded.
Free orders may be included by calling the script with the `--include_free` option,
or passing `include_free=True` to `download_orders`. The same can be achieved for
refunded orders using `--include_refunded` or `include_refunded=True`.

You can also extract a single year by specifying the `--single_year` option or passing `single_year=YEAR` to `download_orders`. (thanks to @tribut)

Additionally, if you have 2 Factor Authentication set up for you Amazon account,
you will be asked for your authentication code when running this from your terminal.
When using this from another project, you can also pass your authentication code to `download_orders`. (thanks to @tribut)
